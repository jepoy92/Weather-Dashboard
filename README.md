# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

This weather dashboard was created using Jquery, ajax methods, and the openweathermap api to create an app that will give the user
information about any city they search. 

## Features

## 1. City search: 

    Using the openweathermap api, the user can search for a city and the app uses jquery to search through the api in order to provide the following information

    1. City name
    1. City temperature 
    2. Wind speed
    3. Humidity
    4. UV index 

## 2. Current date and time:

    The user is presented with the current date and time using moment.js

## 3. Five day Forecast: 

    When the user selects a city, a five day forecast of that city's is presented below. 

## 4. Local Weather:

    With the user's permission, the app can also display the user's local weather information using the geolocation feature in 
    javascript.

## 5 Saved city information:

When the page is refreshed the user can re-use their recently searched cities which were saved through localstorage.
